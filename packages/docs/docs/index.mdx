EmbraceSQL for data access -- you write the SQL -- we’ll do the REST!

Learn about the [Problems](./problems) with data access. Then [Get Started](#getting-started).

## Getting Started

You'll need to have Docker [installed](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

Run the EmbraceSQL Docker container with our sample SQLite database. You can do
this in any directory you like, just know that files will be created there!

```shell
docker pull embracesql/server
docker run embracesql/server init > docker-compose.yaml
docker-compose up
```

Now you'll see some output from EmbraceSQL starting. `docker-compose` is used to get access to the current directory and the port 8765.

Check out the OpenAPI at http://localhost:8765/ with a browser, notice the `hello` route, GET it!

```shell
curl http://localhost:8765/default/hello
```

In your shell in the current directory where you ran EmbraceSQL, do a quick `ls`.

- Notice the ./docker-compose.yaml -- that’s to make it easy to use EmbraceSQL+Docker in development
- Notice the ./Dockerfile -- that's going to be used to build and deploy your server
- Notice the ./embracesql.yaml -- that’s the config
- Notice the ./embracesql.db -- that’s a sample database, in SQLite
- Notice the ./default/hello.sql -- that’s what just ran
- Notice the ./migrations -- we’ll get to that
- Notice the ./client -- that's where generated client library modules live

Replace the contents of `hello.sql`.

```sql title="./default/hello.sql"
SELECT :stuff AS message
```

EmbraceSQL

And now use that parameter, just set it on the query string by name.

```shell
curl http://localhost:8765/default/hello?stuff=world
```

And of course, you can post your parameters. We're not being pedantic about REST!

```shell
curl --request POST --data '{"stuff": "world"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8765/default/hello
```

And that's it -- you have just created a REST API with nothing but SQL.

Not only a REST API -- but you have generated a complete JavaScript/TypeScript client library with autocomplete, and [AutoCRUD](./sqlmodules#autocrud).

Create a file in the current directory -- right next to the

```javascript title="./hello.ts"
import { EmbraceSQL } from "./client/node";

const client = EmbraceSQL("http://localhost:8765");

const example = async (): Promise<void> => {
  const echoed = await client.databases.default.hello.sql({ stuff: "world" });
  console.log(echoed);
};
example();
```

And now run it!

```shell
npx ts-node ./hello.ts
```

From here, let's make something more sophisticated with [Databases](./databases), [Tables](./tables), and [SQL Modules](./sqlmodules).
