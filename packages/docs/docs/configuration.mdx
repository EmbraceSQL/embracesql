## Environment Variables

You can have any environment variables you like to be interpolated in your `embracesql.yaml` config.

### EMBRACEQL_ROOT

By default, this is the current working directory, but you can set any directory you like to be the root.
EmbraceSQL will look in this directory for its configuration and write generated files here.

## Example Confguration

Best way to understand the configuration is with a full sample.

Databases are 'named', names such as `default`, `other`, and these names are used
in the generation of clients and typed context.

```yaml title="./embracesql.yml"
databases:
  default: sqlite:embracesql.db
  other: sqlite:other.db
  postgres: postgresql://${USER}:${PASSWORD}@${HOST}:${PORT}/${DB}
twinCommandsTo: kafka:hostname:port/topic
```

## File Tree

You run EmbraceSQL in any folder you like -- this is the root.
A root folder should look like:

```bash title="/"
after.js
afterBatch.js
afterError.js
afterMigration.js
before.js
beforeBatch.js
beforeMigration.js
beforeStreamMessage.js
embracesql.yml
default/
    things/
        all.sql
        all.sql.before.js
        all.sql.beforeBatch.js
        all.sql.after.js
        all.sql.afterBatch.js
        all.sql.afterError.js
        add.sql
        add.sql.before.js
        add.sql.beforeBatch.js
        add.sql.after.js
        add.sql.afterBatch.js
        add.sql.afterError.js
migrations/
    000.sql
    001.sql
resolveSQL.js
validateToken.js
```

You can make any folders you like to organize your SQL, starting with a folder per database, and then organizing as you see fit. 
In this example, `default`
The path on disk becomes the relative path to invoke via REST with `/`, and via SDK client libraries via '.'. 
Within each database folder, organize by use case or topic area of your application.
