title: Generated Client Libraries
---

## Getting Started

EmbraceSQL generates client libraries for JavaScript and TypeScript along with type definitions for your databases, tables, and SQL modules automatically, creating files on disk you can reference for client code and handler implementations.

The big benefit of these clients, compared to just using an HTTP client library is type autocompletion in your editor, and for folks so inclined, static type checking with the TypeScript compiler.

## React Hooks

EmbraceSQL generates a complete set of React hooks for each of your SQL modules as well as all AutoCRUD methods. The EmbraceSQL client is shared through React context.

These hooks use the generated client APIs for you to offer a declarative, React style interface.

## Admin Dashboard

EmbraceSQL creates an administrative dashboard for your databases automatically, with some pretty conventient features:

- React components for each table and column that can be used in your own apps too!
- One click drill down for master-detail record relationships based on referential integrity
- AutoCRUD forms for each record with
  - Create/Read/Update/Delete hooks
  - Replaceable field editors
  - Autocomplete hooks
  - Field validation hooks
- Query diagnostics
  - Last N queries executed
  - Execution time

## Convenience Features

- Automatic Retry

  - Helps deal with little network blips
  - A bit of exponential backoff to avoid flooding

- SourceMaps & Debugging
  - Client libraries have source maps inside
  - You can also attach to the EmbraceSQL server with a JS debugger!
