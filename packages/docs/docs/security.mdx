## Getting Started

EmbraceSQL doesn't log users in itself -- it is counting on your app to do that -- and you pass along an ID Token in requests in order to establish user identity.
You can use any id token style, transported in any HTTP header you like, and provide your own event handler to validate a token and add to the execution context.

However, there is an open standard that works great. 

## OpenID Connect

EmbraceSQL supports OpenID Connect ID Tokens in the `Authorization: Bearer <id_token>` header, passed in with each API call, and made available through the context without any additional work on your part.

JWT tokens need to be decoded, and verified. 
EmbraceSQL supports automatic key discovery for Open ID Connect issuers.

What EmbraceSQL does not do -- is create or issue tokens, you get these from your identity provider.

### Cryptographic Keys

OpenID Connect ID Tokens are signed by Identity Providers, with the well known public providers (Google, Microsoft, etc) using public key encryption.
When EmbraceSQL sees `Authorization: Bearer <id_token>` in an http request, either direct via `POST` or `GET`, or through a generated client library, a few things happen:

- EmbraceSQL _decodes_ the token, resulting in a plain object of name value pairs
- Looking in the token, EmbraceSQL finds the `iss` -- the issuer -- and uses OpenID Connect Discovery to fetch public keys
- If you have [configured](./configuration#openid) a list of supported OpenID issuers, `iss` is compared to that list.
- The token's signature is verified
- If the token signature verification fails, a `401` status is returned, which will be an exception in generated clients
- Expired tokens fail validation

So -- if you send the `Authorization: Bearer <id_token>` you can count on all requests being authenticated.

### Key Caching

EmbraceSQL will download and cache keys for you in the `${EMBRACESQL_ROOT}/.keys` folder.
This speeds authentication and verification by eliminating any need to go out over the network.

Keys are stored as JSON Web Key files named `${EMBRACESQL_ROOT}/.keys/<keyid>.json`.
You can have multiple `.json` files, and EmbraceSQL will try them for you, allowing multiple key providers if needed.

## Authentication and Identity

It's one thing to authenticate the user to allow them access at all -- but another to use that identity to authorize running specific queries.
EmbraceSQL provides you user identity, and lets you use code in handlers to implement authorization.

### OpenID ID Tokens

Once a token is decoded and verified, it is added to the context as `context.token`, you can get all the claims from a JWT token inline in any handler.
This is the complete, original token, decoded from JSON into an object, with all fields available.

For example:

```typescript title="${EMBRACESQL_ROOT}/default/hello.before.ts" file=../../engine/tests/configs/security/default/hello.before.ts
```

### `allow` and `deny` Access

In any given handler, you can `context.allow()` or `context.deny()` access at any location in code.

You can pass any object you like to `context.allow()` and `context.deny()`. 
These passed objects are recorded and appended to an array `context.grants[]` which provides a per query security access log.

OK -- here is how this works, when you call `context.deny()`, the current access state of the context is set to prevent any query from executing.

When you call `context.allow()`, the current access state of the context is set to allow query processing.

That's it -- it's a big on/off switch.

So rather than devise a 'security markup language', EmbraceSQL just has you decide if you want to deny or allow access inside handlers, with real code, so you don't need to learn yet another security markup language.

## Security Cookbook

### Secure by Default

To set up a secure by default system, you just create one root handler:

```typescript title="${EMBRACESQL_ROOT}/before.ts" file=../../engine/tests/configs/security/before.ts
```

And that is it -- no query will run.

### Secure by Authenticated User Domain

Let's further assume you have set up Google OpenID Connect to authenticate your users, and you are passing that id token in your `Authorization: Bearer <id_token>` on requests to EmbraceSQL.

Google tokens provide a validated email -- the user would have received an email to that address they needed to click to verify to have an active account.
So we just check the domain name in the email with a simple regular expression - note the use of `$` -- we want to be at the end, so `user@yourdomain.com` but not `user@yourdomain.com.hackerz.co`.
For example:

```typescript title="${EMBRACESQL_ROOT}/default/before.ts" file=../../engine/tests/configs/security/default/before.ts
```

### SQL Driven Row Security

Assume you have a multi-tenant, or multi-user database and you want to limit which rows can be seen.

One way to do this -- but you have a lot of flexibility with code and handlers, is to set up a domain tenant table, and have a tenant identifier on each row in other tables.

Here is a sample migration:

```sql title="${EMBRACESQL_ROOT}/migrations/default/000_multitenant.sql"
-- SQLite style
CREATE TABLE tenants (
  tenant_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  domain TEXT NOT NULL,
  UNIQUE(domain)
);
```

```sql title="${EMBRACESQL_ROOT}/migrations/default/001_multitenant.sql"
CREATE TABLE multi_tenant_things (
  thing_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  thing_value TEXT NOT NULL,
  tenant_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY(tenant_id) REFERENCES tenants(tenant_id)
)
```

Here is the SQL you need to make this work:

```sql title="${EMBRACESQL_ROOT}/default/tenant.sql"
SELECT tenant_id WHERE domain = :domain
```

```sql title="${EMBRACESQL_ROOT}/default/my_things.sql"
SELECT thing_id, thing_value
FROM multi_tenant_things
WHERE tenant_id = :tenant_id
```

And some handlers, we'll limit access to known domains, and be secure by default.
Remember you will need to pass a bearer token that will decode and validate.
Remember that this is a root folder handler, so you only need to have this one time in your whole system.

```javascript title="${EMBRACESQL_ROOT}/before.js"
export const before = (context) => {
  // secure by default, nobody can query
  context.deny({});
  // but if there is a token
  if (context.token) {
    // pick off the back half of the email, and throw an exception otherwise
    const domain = context.token.email.split("@")[1];
    // issue a query to get the tenant
    // and add it to the context parameters -- matching the named parameter in my_things.sql
    // notice you don't need to tell it a row, or iterate rows here -- just a little convenience!
    const {tenant_id} = await context.databases.default.tenant({domain}).tenant_id;
    context.parameters.tenant_id = tenant_id;
    context.allow({ domain, tenant_id });
  }
};
```

And that is it -- now every query will be passed a `tenant_id` parameter, validated against a control table of known domains, authenticated by a third party OpenID Connect provider.

What you'll need to remember to do:

- Put the `:tenant_id` in your where clauses in your SQL
- Authenticate your users with OpenID Connect
- Pass the `Authorization: Bearer <id_token>` header

### PostgreSQL Row Security

Integrating with PostgreSQL [row level security](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/ddl-rowsecurity.html) is even easier.
You set your policies in SQL as specified by PostgreSQL, and all you need to do is tell EmbraceSQL who is the current user.
Note that you don't need to create a database user for each possible user in PostgreSQL, and you don't need to have an extra parameter tacked on to all your SQL.

```javascript title="./before.ts"
export const before = async (context) => {
  // secure by default, no queries allowed
  context.deny({});
  if (context.token) {
    // something simple, email is the user identity
    const current_user = context.token.email;
    // and we will use the domain as the role
    const domain = context.token.email.split("@")[1];
    // let PostgreSQL know -- EmbraceSQL looks in current_user and role
    // and adds those to the database query request
    context.current_user = current_user;
    context.role = domain;
    context.allow({ current_user, role: domain });
  }
};
```

And that is it, EmbraceSQL will call `SET LOCAL SESSION AUTHORIZATION ${context.current_user}` and `SET LOCAL ROLE ${context.role}` for you, bridging in to the native access control concepts in PostgreSQL.

## Database Account Security

EmbraceSQL connects to your database, so it needs an account in your database to work.

The database account you use for EmbraceSQL can have any access level you like, but know that if you limit access, some features may not work.
For example, if you do not grant `DELETE` to your database account, AutoCRUD cannot delete.

Migration support requires EmbraceSQL to create one table `_embrace_sql_migrations_` in each database, and have permissions that match the contents of your migration scripts.
