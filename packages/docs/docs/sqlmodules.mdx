title: SQL Modules
---

import Mermaid from "../src/mermaid";

## Getting Started

A given SQL file defines a new Modules, which exposes an API, automatically sets up [event queues](./events), generates Data Handlers templates, and [Generated Client Libraries](./clients).
You just type SQL, EmbraceSQL does the rest.
This is a different approach than ORMs, which generate a meta schema, or a mapping, which you then use in application code, which then generates SQL at runtime.
This is a SQL first approach, and you are going to type a whole lot less to use it, as well as be able to access legacy databases.

The SQL you write is the SQL that is going to run. You are in full control and will not need to learn a new way to write SQL.

As a simple example, let's make two new API endpoints in a directory by creating some sql files. These are tucked under the `./default` meaning they are for the defatult database.

```sql title="./migrations/001.sql" file=../../engine/tests/configs/sqlmodules-transactions/migrations/default/001.sql

```

```sql title="./migrations/002.sql" file=../../engine/tests/configs/sqlmodules-transactions/migrations/default/002.sql

```

```shell
docker run -v ${PWD}:/var/embracesql embracesql/server migrate
```

And now the sql scripts to define the sql modules.

```sql title="./default/all.sql" file=../../engine/tests/configs/sqlmodules-transactions/default/all.sql

```

```sql title="./default/add.sql" file=../../engine/tests/configs/sqlmodules-transactions/default/add.sql

```

Notice the named parameters.
You can set up named parameters using `:name` where `name` can be any continuous string you like.
This format is as raw a sql as possible, with the specific idea that you can open and edit an SQL file using your favorite SQL editor or IDE to interactively test and build your query.
EmbraceSQL doesn't dictate any particular developer tools.

Go to your directory and start the server.

```shell
docker-compose up
```

If you open a browser to http://localhost:8765/ you will see EmbraceSQL has picked up your new files and there are now new APIs.

Go ahead and give these APIs a test. This will give you a before and after look.

```shell
curl http://localhost:8765/default/all
curl --request POST --data '{"id": 100, "name": "cake"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:8765/default/things/add
curl http://localhost:8765/default/all
```

## Data Handlers

Data Handlers are an opportunity for you to add bits of code to handle events in the EmbraceSQL SQL module lifecycle. Data access can _almost always_ be pulled of with straight SQL, but sometimes you need a little adjustment.

Back in the local directory do `ls default` -- notice a few new files:

```bash
TODO: make this a dynamic ls
```

Take a look inside -- these are data handlers, generated in TypeScript. `before` provides the ability to intercept a query on the way in, and `after` results on the way out.

:::tip
Handlers are optional -- you can just write SQL. You probably _should_ just write SQL.
:::

You are really limited only by your imagination, but some suggestions for `before` handlers:

- Check security with code (more on our security model later)
- Re-write or replace parameter values

And for `after` handlers:

- Remove or obfuscate secure data at the row/column level
- Make an additional query for more or associated data with EmbraceSQL

Data Handlers are hierarchical, to allow defaults, and to cut down copy and paste programming.
Starting from a any `foo.sql`, EmbraceSQL looks for `foo.sql.[event].ts` for a given event, across all extensions.
From there, the local directory `[event].ts`, and repeatedly up each directory to the root directory where EmbraceSQL is running.
This is the event handler chain.

Here is a picture of the event handler chain:

<Mermaid
  chart={`
stateDiagram
  br: Root level before handler
  bf: Folder level before handler
  bff: File level before handler
  aff: File level after handler
  af: Folder level after handler
  ar: Root level after handler
  [*] --> br
  br --> bf
  bf --> bff
  bff --> aff
  aff --> af
  af --> ar
  ar --> [*]
`}
/>

Let’s look inside the `add` handlers, and tweak some parameters.

```typescript title="${EMBRACESQL_ROOT}/add.before.js" file=../../engine/tests/configs/sqlmodules/default/add.before.ts
```

And after the query -- let's read back the rows.
This pretty handy as a general trick by the way to read back a lookup table.

```typescript title="${EMBRACESQL_ROOT}/add.before.js" file=../../engine/tests/configs/sqlmodules/default/add.after.ts
```

And now -- give it a try, not only will you have a slightly different name than what you sent in -- you will get rows back as well, with one API call, instead of the two we previously ran.

```shell
curl --request POST --data '{"id": 200, "name": "ahoy"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
 http://localhost:8765/default/add
```

The advantage here is you can batch up multiple interactions, even with multiple databases, behind a single trip over the network.

### Context

The Data Handler execution model relies on a `context`, which is shared between all handlers in a chain.
This is the _one parameter_ passed to each handler, potentialy modified by a handler, and is available subsequent handlers.
This one parameter approach allows for a simple call signature, and a shared 'blackboard' pattern between your handlers and the EmbraceSQL engine itself.

EmbraceSQL itself creates this context when an SQL module call starts, and augments this context when running the SQL through to the database, adding the results from the database.

This shared context, and single parameter call signature for handlers makes handlers more consistent and affords easy access to object destructuring syntax features to pick out the bits of context you find interesting in your application.

The actual `context` is typed, and generated based on the SQL you write and the schema of your database.
As you change the SQL, the type of the `parameters` and `results` properties in particular will change.
This is particularly handy as it allows autocomplete while editing your handlers!

### Using Multiple Databases

We've seen in [Databases](./databases) that you can have multiple databases -- so then -- how does an API -- an .sql file -- know which database to use?

The answer is -- folders.
Each folder under the EmbraceSQL root correspondes to a named database, with the exception of the reserved folders under `migrations`.

## SQL Dialect

EmbraceSQL does not define a new SQL dialect, it passes your SQL through directly to each database. This lets you use SQL fully, along with all the advanced features of your database, without the traditional limits created by ORM style query generators. It also lets you write SQL files with your existing favorite SQL editing tools.

The trade-off is of couse, you need to know the SQL of you database! The good news is you won't need to learn yet another query language, or an API that generates a quey language and keep _that_ mapping in your head.

## Transactions

For any given database, you can begin, commit, or rollback a transaction at any time in any handler. You can do this in SQL, and you can do this in handler code.

Any transaction that was not committed by the time data is returned is automatically rolled back, meaning and `INSERT` `UPDATE` or `DELETE` will have no permanent effect.
Data can still return, which can let you do somewhat clever things like, insert data, read it back, and then an automatic roll back will happen.
This is a handy trick for database testing, where you can let transactions ‘undo’ the test data changes for you, restoring your database to a pristine state by having a conditional on your `commit`.

For example, let's modify a previous handler:

```typescript title="${EMBRACESQL_ROOT}/add.before.ts" file=../../engine/tests/configs/sqlmodules-transactions/default/add.before.ts
```

```typescript title="${EMBRACESQL_ROOT}/add.before.ts" file=../../engine/tests/configs/sqlmodules-transactions/default/add.after.ts
```

And behold the rollback, which you can see in your shell.

```shell
curl http://localhost:8765/things/all
curl --request POST --data '{"id": 100, "name": "cough"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"  http://localhost:8765/things/add
curl http://localhost:8765/things/all
```

This will show the table, then a modified table, then back to the original table.

## AutoCRUD

It's great to be able to have the full power of SQL when you need it -- but sometimes you just need to do some basic CRUD. EmbraceSQL automatically inspects your databases and creates default SQL Modules for your tables for working with single and multiple records operations by key, eliminating a big pile of very tedious coding and testing.

Let's set up some tables for a really vanilla shopping cart, in our default testing SQLite database and see how this works. We'll have a pretty normal set or orders, items to order, and an association table to put items in an order.

```sql title="${EMBRACESQL_ROOT}/migrations/003.sql" file=../../engine/tests/configs/sqlmodules-autocrud/migrations/default/003.sql

```

```sql title="${EMBRACESQL_ROOT}/migrations/004.sql" file=../../engine/tests/configs/sqlmodules-autocrud/migrations/default/004.sql

```

```sql title="${EMBRACESQL_ROOT}/migrations/005.sql" file=../../engine/tests/configs/sqlmodules-autocrud/migrations/default/005.sql

```

```shell
docker run embrace-sql migrate
```

Without writing any SQL at all, you get a REST interface for these tables.

- `POST` new rows to tables to Create
- `GET` table rows by key to Read
- `UPDATE` particular fields to values to Update
- `DELETE` by key to Delete

You can also make `before` and `after` handlers for these automatically generated SQL modules, without needing to write the SQL.
The way to think about it is -- EmbraceSQL has a lot of SQL built in for the common cases, and you can write any SQL you like for more complex cases. Whether you write the sql, or EmbraceSQL has it built in, you can always create event handlers to intercept query results and modify them as needed.

Even more powerful, with [Generated Client Libraries](./clients), you have typing and autocompletion available for you for every API. Let's see how AutoCRUD looks from TypeScript. So you can get a lot of data access without any SQL or mapping at all.

```typescript
import EmbraceSQL from "./embrace-sql";

const client = new EmbraceSQL("http://localhost:8765");
```

```typescript file=../../engine/tests/examples/orders_items.ts
```

```typescript
example(client);
```

### Error Handling

Some errors are more critical than others. Sometimes you want to keep going, sometimes you want to abort. EmbraceSQL is a bit of a perfectionist, and aborts the entire request on any unhandled error. You can be more forgiving though, and decide to keep going by creating an error handler:

```typescript title="${EMBRACESQL_ROOT}/default/hello.afterError.ts" file=../../engine/tests/configs/hello-handler/default/hello.afterError.ts
```

You can also `try/catch` in your handler code, so in practice the `error` event handlers are useful to capture errors coming back from your database engine.

## Invoking SQL Modules

There are three styles of invocation:

- Request/Response via REST
- Request/Response via generated client libraries
- Request/Response -- embedded -- via generated client libraries

### REST

Every SQL Module is exposed via REST, as shown in examples.
These work until complete and return to the caller, transactions roll back automatically if any timeout occurs.

### Cient Library

Client libraries are typed wrappers that support auto-complete, but are really just REST under the hood, using the client to give you nice autocomplete, communicating to the server with REST, and coming back.

### Client Library -- Embedded

In this style, there is no REST, your process has EmbraceSQL in it as a TypeScript module.
Calls to the generated client library invoke database access directly from your process.
This is useful for making your own node server that uses EmbraceSQL as the data access library, as well as to have autocomplete and strong types with SQLite in process in React Native applications.

Having an API is great, now let's add [Security](./security).
