title: Embedded
---

## Getting Started

EmbraceSQL can run in _embedded mode_, which is aimed at two use cases:

- Making a React Native application with inline SQLite
- Making a Node command line program for database interaction
- Making a Node server program with inline database access

In all cases, it is recommended that you set up a multiple package repo, with a minimum of two pacakges:

- The EmbraceSQL root package
- Your app (1+ packages at your discretion)

So, here is a handy skeleton you can start from:

```shell
yarn add -g https://github.com/embracesql/embracesql.git
git clone https://github.com/wballard/skeleton.git
cd skeleton
yarn
yarn test
```

And now -- configure EmbraceSQL -- this will start from an empty directory
and get everything in place for you to start working.

```shell
yarn install -g @embracesql/cli
mkdir packages/databases
embracesql embedded packages/databases --nowatch
yarn
```

This does something a little different -- rather than run a server, this generates a package with EmbraceSQL inside.

Now when you are developing, you can keep the code generator running:

```shell
npx run embracesql embedded --nowatch packages/databases
```

This will watching will look out for any `.sql` or `.ts` file changes and regenerate.
This is how you generally will want to proceed for development.

If you are scripting up as part of a one time build -- you can run with the `--nowatch` option.

## Adding a CLI

Now it's time to make a super simple database driven hello world. Make a new package:

```shell
mkdir packages/hello
```

Add in a package.

```json title="packages/hello/package.json"
{
  "name": "hello",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "license": "MIT",
  "dependencies": {
    "@embracesql/engine": "*",
    "databases": "*",
    "ts-node": "*"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "hello": "ts-node hello.ts"
  }
}
```

And we'll need to link up our multirepo.

```shell
yarn
```

We'll code up a simple hello world. You are welcome to copy and paste this code!
But if you type it -- you'll get a feel for the autocomplete!

```typescript title="packages/hello/hello.ts"
// this is our actual embedded database.
import { EmbraceSQLEmbedded } from "databases";

const main = async () => {
  const embedded = await EmbraceSQLEmbedded();
  console.log(await embedded.databases.default.hello({}));
};
main();
```

And now run it!

```shell
cd packages/hello
yarn hello
```
